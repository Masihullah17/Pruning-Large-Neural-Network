# Pruning-Large-Neural-Network
Training a large neural network and then making it small by pruning it's weights/neurons

I am uploading the final results after pruning the network. 
Firstly, "weights pruning" . 
Secondly, "Unit/Neuron pruning" . 
Plots of "percent sparsity Vs accuracy" for both techniques.
